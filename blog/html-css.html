    <h1> Inline vs Inline Blocks</h1>
    

 </head>

<body>
  <p> The main difference between inline and inline block is that inline block allows you to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>set width</li>
    <li>set hight</li>
  </ul>
  <p> and with in-line the following are not respected;</p>
   <ul> 
  <li> top & bottom margins</li>
    <li>Paddings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Any element within a program, document or message is called inline.</p> 
   <p> When considering HTML, any code built into the web page is called inline. </p>
    <p>And it does not include any code loaded from an external file. </p>
    <br>
 <p>In any web page, almost all the contents are inline except the CSS and image files. </p>
   <p> Any element that starts a new line for a paragraph and uses the full page or container is called block elements.</p>
    <p>It has one line or multiple lines and possesses a line break before and after the elements in the line. </p>
    <p>CSS can be used for formatting the block element</p>
