    <h2>Over coming a block</h2>
     <p>
      In coding its common to get blocked on a problem and it is something you can deal with in a few ways.
      The problems that can hit you can be heavily detailed, but they can also be extremely simple too.
      There are a number of ways you can do this.
       When learning about “functions”, I was trying to call a simple function for the string “Hello World”. 
       I gave the function a name but after the function by mistake I wrote semi-colons after it.
       I tried and tried changing different things and I could feel frustration building as I couldn’t find a reason why the function wouldn’t work.
       I googled the issue and still couldn’t find out this simple problem it wasn’t until I got someone on discord to read through my code and they picked up on it pretty quickly.
       Sometimes getting away from something and getting it peer reviewed is a great way to problem solve.</p>
  
      <h2>Solving A problem In An Elegant Way</h2>
     <p>Whilst creating a loop for one of the questions, I couldn't figure out how to get it to work.
       I didn't realise at the time, but i had put in the equation  the comparison opperator == instead of a simple = before the 0.
      This out foxed me for some time until i used my go t0 youtube guy "mosh" he has simple 6 minute long tutorials on most java script equations where he clearly shows you
      and walks you through loops,functions, objects etc. I found him to be a very useful tool to use.
      </p>
       



<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
       <p>
         pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in plain English. 
         For me personally, It is something that I would have to get used to as I get more familiar with the language itself!
        </p>
        <h3>Trying Something</h3>
        <p>
          This will probably be my first go to solution in problem solving.
        </p>
        <h3>Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
        <p>
           This method will be very useful once you are more familiar with code in general and it will be a one I will use frequently.
        </p>

        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>Reading error messages is very helpful first insight as it can help to desipher what the problem is and point you in the right direction.</p>

        <h3>Console logging</h3>
        <p>
          Logging messages to the console is a very basic way to diagnose and troubleshoot minor issues in your code.
          This isn't a procedure that I have used that much
        </p>
          
          <h3>Googling</h3>
          <p>
          This method is probably one of the most effective methods to solve a problem and possibly the most popular too 
          as you will always find someone that has a same or similar problem to yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>
          If you are lucky enough to be working with someone asking peers can be very beneficial.
          Allot of companies have a peer review system in place where every piece of code has to be peer reviewed before it is aproved.
      </p>
       <h3>Asking Coaches For Help</h3>
       <p>Asking a facilitator for help is a very good resource to have.
         I will use this as a last port of call if my go to resources don't come up with anything.
        </p>

        <h3>Improving Your Process With Reflection</h3>
        <p>
        Having been in the music industry self reflection is quite a pivotal part of the creative process.
        Having that inner critic really helps you improve your output where music is concerned and was always beneficial to me.
        Self reflecting in Dev Academy has helped allot and it has also made me realise that not all reflection needs to have a harsh inner critic.
