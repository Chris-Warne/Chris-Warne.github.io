     <h3> What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
  <p>
      To get a job as a web dev and build my way up learning all the way.
  </p>
     <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
  <p>
    My main strength is persistency and fortitude. <br>I am not comfortable unless I know the fundamental basics of something and will put in the extra work so that I do.<br> 
    One of my weaknesses is that I tend to over think things and get bogged down if I don’t fully understand.<br> 
    I also have the tendency to get stressed when I feel I should know something when I don’t and put extra pressure on myself to learn.
  </p>
    <h3> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
             
  <p>
    The ability to calmly work through a problem without getting too stressed about it and also to continue to learn and enjoy the process.
  </p>

     <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
  <p>
    I will make sure to step back and take a look at the big picture when things are getting tough.
    To take regular breaks and reach out to people if they or I are having a struggle.
  </p>
            
     <h3>what commitment will you show as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
             
  <p>
    I would try and solve the problem myself by googling at first then if I am still struggling I would reach out to my peers on discord and then the facilitator.
    When In boot camp I will actively ask my peers and then if still struggling my facilitator.
    </p>
     <h3> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
  <p>
    Support, empathy, friendship and clear instruction.
  </p>
            
     <h3> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
               
  <p>
    For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    none that I am aware of

         <h1> Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

     <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
  <p>
    My main objective will be to get a job in the tech industry.I am very interested in cyber security, 
    but I am willing to fine-tune my skills in a work experience enviroment too.<br>
    This will not only help me learn, but will also help me to gauge where i want to be.
  </p>

      <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
             
  <p>
    I think that working in pairs would certainly help and energise me and that is something i look forward to.<br>
    One of my strengths is life experience, so i would be bringing that to the table and communication is a massive part of that.<br>
    I think one area i may struggle on is the retention of information and also working against my (partially) fixed mindset,<br>
    but i think i have already identified my fixed mindset and it is something that i will work on and continue to work on into my career.
  </p>

      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
  <p>
    Having spent 10 years as a professional singer you would think it wouldn't be an issue, <br>
    but i struggle to speak in public, not in small groups, but in larger groups of people.
    Another challenge will be to not get too stressed about things and to calmly work through problems.<br>
    My main worry is to not get left behind.
  </p>
      <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  <p>
    The ability to acknowledge a problem and be abe to use a growth mindset to work through that problem  
    and to also confidently get up infront of my peers and talk through something.
  </p>
            
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
  <p>
    To give full support, not just in a technical way but also in an empathetic way too.
  </p>

      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>
    Whilst in bootcamp I will work as hard as possible, but i will also not hesitate to ask for help when i need it.<br>
    I will be open honest and empathetic to my peers and be available to support them too.<br>
    I will get into dev Academy on-time everyday and take breaks when needed.

  </p>
