    </p>
<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
            <p>
              My main strength is persistency and fortitude. <br>I am not comfortable unless I know the fundamental basics of something and will put in the extra work so that I do.<br> 
              One of my weaknesses is that I tend to over think things and get bogged down if I don’t fully understand.<br> 
              I also have the tendency to get stressed when I feel I should know something when I don’t and put extra pressure on myself to learn.
            </p>
<h3> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
             
            <p>
              The ability to calmly work through a problem without getting too stressed about it and also to continue to learn and enjoy the process.
            </p>

<h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p>
                 I will make sure to step back and take a look at the big picture when things are getting tough.
                 To take regular breaks and reach out to people if they or I are having a struggle.
            </p>
            
<h3>what commitment will you show as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
             
    <p>I would try and solve the problem myself by googling at first then if I am still struggling I would reach out to my peers on discord and then the facilitator.
       When In boot camp I will actively ask my peers and then if still struggling my facilitator.
    </p>
<h3> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
             <p>Support, empathy, friendship and clear instruction.
             </p>
            
 <h3> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
               
            <p>For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
             none that I am aware of
