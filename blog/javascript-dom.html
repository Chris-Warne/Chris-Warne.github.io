        <h2>The Difference Between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Think about an everyday website that has buttons and links to other sites with pages, 
          have you ever wondered how it all works and how it all goes together?  
          This is called front-end development and two of the main tools or languages that puts the sparkle into that website and pull it all together is HTML and CSS
          
          Lets start with HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. 
          Think of HTML like a house, without a solid framework, foundations and a good architect this house will not only have unsound foundations, 
          but it might not work well in its layout either.
          Without a solid base it might even fall over! HTML is the base of your website and like a house has plasterboard and elements inside that holds it all together,
          HTML has also got elements that hold it all together these are called tags.
          Staying in this house we have another tool that helps with the building of your house this is called CSS(cascading Style Sheets). 
          Like the wall paper and the carpets that make your house look nice, CSS is a tool which helps to design the fonts and colour to backgrounds, 
          specify colour and size of text, create boxes of any colour you like.
          Think of CSS as your interior designer, giving your house style.</p>

        <h2>Control And Flow</h2>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes code in a script.The code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line.
          Lets say you are writing a song. There is a process that allot of songwriters use as the structure, that normally follows an order similar to control flow in that, 
          you start off with a melody, then you write the lyrics, create the format of the song, then sing it! 
          This is not strictly rigid, like how sometimes a “control flow” has structures that change too, but I am sure you get the idea.
          A loop is a block of code that can repeat over and over It can repeat until specified conditions are reached. 
          Back in music there is also a software programme or a hardware device called a "loop pedal".You may have seen a musician playing live where he/she them/they, 
          control the amount of times a guitar riff or percussive piece is repeated.This can be repeated into infinity or a said number of times putting conditions into each loop. 
          You can also loop over other loops to build tracks.
          Like in computer code you ask the loop a question(programme in a guitar riff) and the answer is executed.</p>

          <h2>The Dom</h2>
          <p>The Dom(Document Object Model) acts as a type of bridge that allows you to interact and manipulate the contents of it.
            It does this by communicating with the browser allowing you to manipulate the contents.The dom is a "tree like" representation of a web page that gets loaded into your browser.
            To make a HTML document more interactive and dynamic, the script‌‌ needs to be able to access the contents of the document and it also needs to know when the user is interacting with it.‌
            Imagine you are in the recording studio.The guitar player records quite a bland piece of music. Perfectly executed, but just needs a little manipulation/interaction to make it louder and more dynamic.
            You feed the recorded guitar into the mixing desk where you can change the dynamics before it is committed to tape. 
            Here there is a tree like process involved similar to the dom.
            I.E; recording the guitar, feeding into a mixer, manipulating the sound and commiting to tape.</p>

            <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
            <p>An array can store data in an ordered collection that can be indexed and numbered. You can access these values by referring to an index number
              Imagine that you index your grocery shopping you can access a particular index number that will allocate a particular item in your index.
              Objects are variables too, but they can contain much more information.
              Objects are a data structure in javascript which is used to represent “things”. 
              This could be anything like cars, people, musical instruments etc and these objects can contain properties or characteristics within them.</p>

              <h2>Functions</h2>
              <p>In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a piece of code, give it a name and then use it as many times as you want.
                You can access these functions at anytime and they are useful to avoid repeating the same code.You can use a function to wrap that code and reuse it. 
                Instead of copying, pasting, and repeating the same code throughout different parts of your program, you can write that code only in one place using a function. 
                Then you can use it over and over again whenever you have to.You can also create your own function as well as use the built in functions that come with Javascript.
               Its basically creating a custom piece of code that you can access at anytime simply by calling the function</p>
