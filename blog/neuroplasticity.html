    <h2>A growth Mindset</h2>

     
     <p>     
       It was always thought that a persons ability 
       Was fixed and was something you were born with and couldn’t be altered.
      People where thought of as being either naturally “gifted” or not. After years of research, science has realised that the brain in more fluid and malleable and can adapt and expand.
      By adapting a growth mindset, and by applying yourself more and working harder, this allows the brain to re-wire itself by firing its neurons and creating
      new nerve cell networks making new connections that re-maps and strengthens your brains capacity to learn. </p>

      <h2>The benefits Of Neuroplacity And how to Increase It</h2>

        <p>
         Practice, practice, practice.
         As a musician I remember when I first picked up guitar, it literally was an alien foreign object that I had little understanding or thoughts on how to play it properly. 
         After months and months of hard work and persistence, I finally started to get a grasp on chord structures, and how to actually play.
         Slowly but surely I gathered more and more competency and I guess this is where the Neuroplasticity came into effect.
         By applying myself and forging ahead and taking the low points and growing from them when i didnt feel like playing my guitar helped to increase the Neuroplacity in my brain
         and progress with my guitar playing.</p>

         <h2>Why is a growth mindset relevant?</h2>

         <p>The growth mindset is being able to thrive in a challenge and not give up. 
           People with a growth mindset don’t see failure as something to give up on, but as something to grow from and learn.</p>

     <h2>Going Forward With A Growth Mindset</h2>

      <p> I have grown up in a working class background and i have always been lead to believe that you were either born with talent or you weren’t good enough.
        If you felt that you were not good enough then you would fall down in the pecking order. This really isn't the case!
        As I have already started reading the book <em>“Mindset”</em> by Carol Dweck, it has been incredibly insightful and helpful to me already. 
        If I feel myself slipping into a fixed mindset, I will pause re-evaluate the situation and move forward in a growth mindset.</p>
