  <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        When working in a team environment it’s really important to be aware and to understand and respect how your peers are feeling
        and how they might react to a certain situation. <br>Allot of programming can be under a time restraint so there could be allot of stress.
        It’s extremely important to emphasise and communicate in a friendly and understanding manner.
        <br>No two people are the same, so its important to be self aware.

  <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
         One of the most surprising things about core learning is how much your mindset effects how you work.
         When it is brought to your attention it is something that can be worked on and nutured. 
      </p>

  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
       For me the most challenging part of the core learning has been quietening that inner critic and being kinder to myself in a challenging activity.</p>
    
  <h3> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>A vital part of any business is the wellbeing of their staff and the working culture within that business.
        <br>Allot of problem solving and how you react to the problem is a mindset that can be changed and nurtured by feeling valued, 
        listened to and by being empathetic can really help you along to realising that.</p>

  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  
      <p>I feel very strongly about the culture of a workplace.Core is an extremely useful tool that when it is exercised properly can not only benefit the morale of a workspace, 
        <br>but can contribute to the wellbeing of its staff too.</p>
