        Originally from Sunderland England a working class area in the north East of England. 
        I started my career in Electrical wholesaling, but my real passion has always been music. 
        I joined a band shortly after School which included my older brother on guitar and we toured continuously around the north East until we were eventually signed to a record label “Sony”. 
        This was a fantastic part of my life which allowed me to record two albums and travel all around Europe and broaden and expand my mind.
        I think that one of the best things about traveling is meeting different people from all walks of life and that definitely is something that I have always loved doing.<br>Having lived in 4 different countries also gives you a great perspective and gives you an overview of life experience that can’t be under estimated and has left me in no doubt that I am a people person.The core values where I come from in the North East is to work hard, be conscientious and respectful and kind to people and that was drummed into me from a young age.I have carried this with me all of my life and If you ever meet anyone from the North East of England you will probably find that their core values are pretty much the same.

        Back in the days of Electrical wholesaling I was put in a situation where I had to make a decision that I felt was ethically wrong.At a young age I had worked my way up to assistant manager and was told that every invoice to every customer had to be marked up by 30% in order to make a larger profit. Some of these customers where friends and I found it totally unacceptable  that I had to look them in the eye  whilst  plussing their invoice in order to make more profit. This sat extremely bad with me until I brought it up at a managers meeting sighting that it was both unethical and unfair.I argued that these customers were what made us the company we were and if they ever found out they would take their business else where. I eventually persuaded the hierarchy to not plus invoices and they eventually agreed.</p>

        I think one of my strengths in terms of learning development is that I have receptive personality in that I value other people opinions that allow others to express themselves fully.Empathetic and understanding are two other values I feel strongly about. I think on the flip side of that I can tend to be overly empathetic at times, taking on other peoples problems as my own which have a tendency to sap my energy.
        There have in the past been a few instances from very different career paths where there has been resistance or tension. One of the primary things to do Is to listen to other peoples points of view even if you don’t agree with them. Being an active listener who can emphasise and learn to evaluate someone else’s view point will take a large part in helping to resolve a tense situation.</p>
